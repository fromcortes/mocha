                Hey! My name is Dennis Cortes.
              </p>
              <p className="space-mono lh-copy black-60">
                Amongst a couple other clich√© designer traits, I love coffee and the craft
                and culture behind it. I enjoy making my own coffee at home and experimenting
                with different roasts and brewing methods. Over time I've wanted to keep a
                record of coffee shops, roasts, brewing methods, and tools I try out.
              </p>
              <p className="space-mono lh-copy black-60">
                Hence, Taste Notes was born. A little side project for me to update and keep
                memories of my coffee experiences and preferences. This project is mainly for
                myself, but I love seeing people enjoy this site and share their love for coffee.
